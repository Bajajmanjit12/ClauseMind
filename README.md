# ClauseMind 
Semantic Decision Engine for Insurance and Legal Document Queries

## 🚀 Overview

ClauseMind is an AI-powered system that allows users to input natural language queries such as:

> "46-year-old male, knee surgery, Pune, 3-month-old policy"

The system then:
- Parses the query into structured data
- Retrieves relevant clauses from insurance documents, contracts, or emails
- Applies rules or LLM reasoning to give a decision
- Returns a structured JSON with:
  - ✅ Decision (Approved/Rejected)
  - 💰 Amount
  - 📌 Justification (Clause references)

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- 🧠 OpenAI GPT-4 / Claude / Gemini
- 🔍 FAISS / Chroma for vector search
- 📄 PyMuPDF / python-docx for file parsing
- 🧠 LangChain (optional for RAG pipelines)
- 💻 Streamlit (for UI)
- 🐍 Python 3.10+
